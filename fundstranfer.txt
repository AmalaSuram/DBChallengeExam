Below are the some of points I implemented in the given code:

-->Implemented separate classes for controller,service and Repository  to the fundtransfer.
-->On successful transaction, the notification will be triggered to the particular user.
-->When the accountId is not present ,handling the exception. 
-->written dto classes for the fundtransfer
-->deadlock suitation is handled by using synchronized ker word.
-->Test cases were written by using Mockito


future enhancement:

-->using optimistic locking in multithreading we can achieve 100% deadlock suitation.
